# My best practices for software development

This is a collection of my best practices, "how-to"s, quirks, tips, nitpicking
and workflows for anything related to software development (coding, tools, work,
processes).

By having a public repo, I can simply share links and screenshots to specific
docs, without having to repeat myself over and over.
